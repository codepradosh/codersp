you have m no of stalls and n no of cows.the problem is cows become aggresive if they are at same place so we have to keep the distance  maximum between any two cows .....
so our task is to place the cows in such a way that the min diastance between any two cow should be maximum...

ex-
suppose there are 5 stalls...at locations 1,2,4,8,9 and there are 3 cows...
so 1 cow at 1 , 2nd cow at 4 at last cow at 8 or 9...therefore the minimunm distance is 3...so output should be 3....

the searchspace is between 0 to 8(9-1).
we will do the binary search and check with this min distance can we keep all the cows? here mid=4
if the min distance is 4 ,1st cow at 1 ,2nd cow at 1+4=5<8 so at 8,for the last cow there is no stall ......so this is not possible..so e=4-1=3

now mid=1...check....1st at 1 ,2nd at 2 and 3rd at 4
so now we have to check can we also keep the cows with the min diastance >1....so s=1+1=2;

now mid=2...do again

and finally the ans is 3....
